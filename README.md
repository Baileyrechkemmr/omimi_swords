## Approach taken

-  my father wanted a web app that would be able to allow him to make edit and delete info from his pages. client also wanted to have a web page for a blog post, allow users to be able to put an order for a sword, class singe up, as well as a place for him to sell his own swords and knifes. client also want to be able to post on a blog page as well as add images, and alow users to watch a 30 min min documentary about the l6 bainite katana.

## Unsolved problems

- due to the client wanting the web page right away, the mobile version and the movie is not working.

## Notes for latter

- go through and make the web site mobile friendly.

- need to convert dvd to video and audio file.

- might want to go through and make a css file to house all styles.
